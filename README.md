# Where2Meet

Where2meet is a hybrid application that combines the independence of a new system and the services offered by real-time localization and Google maps. It gives users the possibility to find the ideal place to arrange appointments with their loved ones in a more dynamic and simple way. It is only necessary to enter your location, the location of the person you want to meet, the type of establishment you want to go to, price scale and let Where2meet do the rest.
